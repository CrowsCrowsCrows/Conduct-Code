# The Conduct Code

Okay, listen up. We’re not fucking around here. I want you all to learn The Conduct Code forwards, backwards, and to a beat. Oh, you bet there’s going to be a quiz.

First Rule. There are rules.

Second Rule. Be COOL about this.

By becoming a member of the Crows Crows Crows Discord server, you agree to abide by The Conduct Code, and cooperate with the Discord Police who enforce it.

We‭ ‬are‭ ‬committed‭ ‬to‭ ‬providing‭ ‬a‭ ‬friendly,‭ ‬safe,‭ ‬and‭ generally chill place to hang ‬for‭ ‬all,‭ ‬regardless‭ ‬of‭ ‬gender,‭ gender identity, ‬sexual‭ ‬orientation,‭ ‬ability,‭ ‬ethnicity,‭ ‬socioeconomic‭ ‬status,‭ ‬and‭ ‬religion‭ (‬or‭ ‬lack‭ ‬thereof‭)‬.‭
 
The Conduct Code is sacred. We’re gonna be a whole fucking cult up in here and I want robes and chanting and you all to self enforce.

## What Happens If Shit Gets Dark

Misbehavior from any community member will not be tolerated. Anyone asked to stop misbehaving is expected to comply immediately.

If a community member engages in misbehavior, the community Discord Police may take any action they deem appropriate, up to and including a temporary ban or permanent expulsion from the community without warning.

We want to be making games, not moderating you kids, so don’t waste our time by fuckin’ about. We are well meaning (but really, really vengeful) gods.
